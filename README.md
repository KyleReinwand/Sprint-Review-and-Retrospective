# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective

#How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

#Understanding what system the user is using and getting the feedback from user and previous users of what hey want implemented and what changes should be made. Stories #help bring this information out based on each persons experience with the system and what they would implement.

#How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

#I approach each program development asking what do I need to accomplish the task at hand?, what is needed within the program?, will this satisfy whoever uses it?
#The apporaches I hope to use when developing programs is the agile work envirnment, it's more fleible than most options, and provides the best breakdown on what I or #the team needs to complete the project at hand.

#What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

#Doing more than the bare minimum, putting in effort that reflects on other tema members and leadership whether its small contributions in between or one big difference #made to help the team, providing your feedback, your knowledge, your experiences, what you don't know and what you want to know shows everyone how much you are willing #to give to the team and what you believe you can contribute moving forward.
